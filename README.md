## Motive

The Netherlands is rapidly switching to electric driving. But electricity is not yet fossil-free. And when you charge your electric car, you emit CO2. How much CO2 is released depends on where, when and of course how much energy (kWh) you charge. So how do you know how much CO2 is released when you plug your electric car into a specific charging station?

The Green Caravan has developed a data model that combines energy generation and trade across Europe with energy mixes from energy providers. For example, you can accurately request how much CO2, solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, coal, gas and more is in a charging session right down to the charging station. Green Caravan not only has historical data, but also forecasts for the near future.

## Assignment

Create a web application that gives insight into the usage of fossil fuels for charging sessions of electric cars.

### User Stories

1. Fossil electricity from charging station?
As an electric driver, I want to know how much fossil electricity comes from the charging station I am standing next to, so that I know how (un)sustainable it is.
Can we provide insight into this data and display it, for example, via a QR code on the charging station?

2. Find the best charging station
As an electric driver, I would like to know at which charging station I can charge most sustainably, so that I can charge my car as sustainable as possible.

3. Finding the best charging moment at a charging station
As an electric driver, I would like to know when the least fossil electricity comes from my charging station, so that I can charge my car as sustainable as possible.
